# parametric-assertive-tools
My name's Harry, I am designing an open source framework for tools that are adjustable and maluable for everybody's needs and requirements.
They will be designed to help those who struggle with motor issues, making everyday tools more accessible to them.
I will include a format, in which all tools will follow, plus tools that I have designed myself.
All models will be uploaded to this repository, as well as progress updates.
